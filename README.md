# Portfolio Website

## Project Description

This is a personal portfolio website for me, showcasing an introduction, featured projects, and a contact form. The site includes modern features such as dark/light mode, technology icons, and responsive design. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with assets and styles organized for clarity and maintainability.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the repository to your local machine.**
2. **Open the project folder.**
3. To view the site locally, simply open `index.html` in your web browser.
4. Make sure the folder structure is preserved:
   - `index.html` (main site)
   - `css/styles.css` (styles)
   - `js/theme.js` (dark/light mode toggle)
   - `js/github.js` (github fetching data and filtering)
   - `assets/images/me.jpeg` (profile image)
   - `docs/ai-usage-report.md` (AI usage documentation)

No backend or server setup is required. All features work client-side.

## AI Use Summary

AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat and ChatGPT) were used to:

- Generate initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Suggest design improvements and UI features.
- Accelerate development and prototyping.
- Provide code corrections and refactoring advice.
