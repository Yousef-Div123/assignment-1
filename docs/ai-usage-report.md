## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits

- Accelerated development and prototyping.
- Reduced manual coding for repetitive tasks.
- Quick access to best practices and modern design patterns.

### Challenges

I tried to implement dark/light mode using AI. However, the implementation was not done very well, especially in styling. This shows that AI is not always reliable, even for implementing a simple feature such as dark/light mode. In order to build a real project, a deep understanding of web programming concepts is essential.

## Learning Outcomes

- Improved understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.
- Gained experience in UI/UX design and accessibility.
- Learned how to leverage AI tools for rapid prototyping and iteration.
- Developed skills in reviewing, editing, and customizing AI-generated code.

## How I Modified AI Suggestions Responsibly

- Reviewed all AI-generated code for accuracy and relevance.
- Customized layouts, colors, and content to match personal and project needs.
- Ensured accessibility and responsiveness in design.
- Tested features and fixed issues that arose from AI suggestions.
- Used the AI-generated code as a base and improved or fixed functionality myself.
